   This project involves designing a versatile robot to tackle two assigned tasks: locating and interacting with a red beacon (disabling a button) and a green beacon (removing it from the arena). The robot's design includes a square chassis with strategically positioned motors and wheels for movement, an adjustable arm for task execution, and sensors for navigation.The team is divided into sub-groups handling robot construction, movement coding, and circuit board assembly. The coding involves sequential stages for beacon interactions, utilizing the robot's arm functions effectively. Overall, the project showcases innovative robot design and efficient task completion through a well-structured approach.
